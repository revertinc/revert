### Quick Start

-   The docs are still in the works so if do find any confusion, do write to us and let us know.

-   You would need API keys to use any API offered by Revert. If you don't have one please contact.

### Get your API keys

Your API requests are authenticated using API keys in the header. Any request that doesn't include an API key will
return an error. You can generate an API key from your Dashboard at any time.

### Make your first request

You can use our postman collection to test out the APIs while you build with us.

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/2349878-242c37a7-c6c8-4bba-b4c4-456a40152ca6?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D2349878-242c37a7-c6c8-4bba-b4c4-456a40152ca6%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D1be47d93-ae8d-44a5-9899-75a00497511a)

To make your first request, send an authenticated request to the ping endpoint `https://api.revert.dev/crm/ping`

This will serve as a test if the connection is successful or not and if you have the right permissions.

### Frontend SDKs
