# Requirements
## System Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following applications and their minimum versions installed, in addition to Node.js and yarn (as mentioned earlier):

- **Node.js 18.0.0** or later
- **Yarn 3.0.2** or later
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## System Requirements

## Get Started
### setup

1 . Clone the forked repository and open the created directory

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/revert.git
cd revert
```

2 . Install dependencies

```shell 
yarn
```

3 . backend setup

# @revertdotdev/backend

```shell
# Copy the example env file
cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env

# Update this .env file with your own secrets if you'd like to.
```

### Fern setup

-   Login with Fern with `fern login`.
-   To generate Fern drive code locally, run `yarn fern` in the root folder of this repo. This will create the `packages/backend/generated` folder with the generated code.

### Setup Redis

-   Have a redis instance running locally or use https://upstash.com/ to get a redis url.
-   Update the redis url in `.env`

### Seed the database

```shell
# seed the database with sample data
yarn workspace @revertdotdev/backend db-seed
```

### Running the API locally

-   Run 
```shell 
yarn workspace @revertdotdev/backend dev 
``` 
to the run service locally at `:4001`

4 . client setup

# @revertdotdev/client

```shell
# Copy the example env file
cp packages/client/.env.example packages/client/.env

# Update this .env file with your own secrets if you'd like to.
```

1. Generate a Tunnel URL

- First, generate a tunnel URL using 
  ```shell
    ngrok http 3000
  ```
- Copy this URL to your clipboard as you'll need it in the next steps.

2. Configure Clerk Webhook Endpoint

- Access your Clerk dashboard.
- Navigate to the webhook settings or configuration section.
- Ensure that the webhook endpoint is set to `clerk/webhook` 

3. Sign Up in Your Application

 - Use your application to sign up a new user. This action will trigger a user creation event.
 - In your Clerk dashboard, you should now see a user.created object associated with the newly signed-up user.

4. Testing with Postman

 - To verify that Clerk is sending user creation notifications to your endpoint, you can use Postman for testing.

 - Open Postman and create a new request.

 - Set the HTTP method to POST.

 - In the request's URL field, use http://localhost:4001/clerk/webhook. This is the endpoint Clerk will send notifications to.

 - In the request body, paste the user.created object that you copied from your Clerk dashboard.
